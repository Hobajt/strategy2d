# Export sounds from MPQ files

### Steps:
- own a legal copy of Warcraft II (available at GOG)
- download MPQ Editor and Listfiles from <a href="http://www.zezula.net/en/mpq/download.html">here</a>
- locate the **War2Dat.mpq** file in the game installation folder and open it via the editor
- click *Add Listfile* button and pick the *Warcraft II BNE.txt* file from the downloaded listfiles
- right-click the *Gamesfx/* directory in MPQ and select *Extract*
- once the directory is extracted, move it into *res/sounds/* in this project

The game will work without the sounds though
